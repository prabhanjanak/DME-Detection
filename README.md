# Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

## Overview
Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. DME occurs when damaged retinal blood vessels leak fluid into the macula, causing swelling.

## Causes
In people with diabetes, high blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels in the retina (diabetic retinopathy). When these vessels are damaged, they may leak fluid and blood into the retina, including the macula, resulting in macular edema.

## Symptoms
DME can cause several vision issues, such as:
- Blurry or distorted vision
- Difficulty reading
- Inability to see colors properly
- Potential vision loss if left untreated

## Risk Factors
Factors that increase the risk of developing DME include:
- Long-standing diabetes
- Poor blood sugar control
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol

## Diagnosis
